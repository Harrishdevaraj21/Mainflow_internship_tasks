        "*   Selecting an appropriate model (`RandomForestClassifier`) and defining a comprehensive hyperparameter search space.\n",
        "*   Utilizing `GridSearchCV` with F1-score as the optimization metric to find optimal hyperparameters, resulting in a best cross-validation F1-score of 0.87699.\n",
        "*   Evaluating the tuned model on a test set, achieving a robust F1-score of 0.8846 and an ROC AUC score of 0.9565, indicating strong discriminatory power.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Feature Engineering**: New ratio features (`rooms_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, `population_per_household`) were successfully created and added to the DataFrame, demonstrating the ability to generate features that could enhance model performance in a real fraud detection scenario. This step was performed on a sample housing dataset due to the unavailability of a fraud-specific dataset.\n",
        "*   **Model Selection and Parameter Grid**: A `RandomForestClassifier` was chosen for its robustness, and a parameter grid was defined, including `n_estimators` ([50, 100, 200]), `max_depth` ([None, 10, 20]), `min_samples_leaf` ([1, 5, 10]), and `min_samples_split` ([2, 5, 10]).\n",
        "*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: `GridSearchCV` was successfully executed using a dummy binary target on the housing dataset.\n",
        "    *   The tuning process identified the optimal hyperparameters as `max_depth`: `None`, `min_samples_leaf`: `1`, `min_samples_split`: `5`, and `n_estimators`: `200`.\n",
        "    *   The best cross-validation F1-score achieved during tuning was 0.87699.\n",
        "*   **Tuned Model Evaluation**: The model with optimal hyperparameters was evaluated on the test set (using the dummy target from the housing dataset).\n",
        "    *   The model achieved an Accuracy of 0.8857, Precision of 0.8925, Recall of 0.8768, F1-Score of 0.8846, and an ROC AUC Score of 0.9565.\n",
        "    *   The confusion matrix indicated `2283` True Negatives, `269` False Positives, `314` False Negatives, and `2234` True Positives, suggesting a good balance but with a slightly higher rate of missed fraud (False Negatives).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   Apply the established feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning pipeline to the actual fraud detection dataset. This will allow for the development of domain-specific features and the optimization of the model for real-world fraud detection challenges.\n",
        "*   Given the common imbalance in fraud datasets, further optimize model evaluation by focusing on metrics like Recall (to minimize missed fraud cases) or ROC AUC, and consider advanced techniques such as SMOTE or class weighting during training if the actual fraud dataset proves to be highly imbalanced.\n"

        "    *   Categorical features ('TransactionType', 'Location', 'DeviceType', 'TimeOfDay') were converted into numerical representations using Label Encoding.\n",
        "*   **Feature Engineering**: Four new features were created to enhance the model's predictive power:\n",
        "    *   `customer_avg_amount`: Average transaction amount for each customer.\n",
        "    *   `customer_transaction_count`: Total number of transactions for each customer.\n",

        "    *   A Decision Tree Classifier was instantiated and trained on the preprocessed training data.\n",
        "*   **Initial Model Performance**: The trained Decision Tree model's performance on the test set showed:\n",
        "    *   Overall Accuracy: 0.8803\n",
        "    *   Precision (for fraudulent transactions, Class 1): 0.4231, meaning that 42.31% of transactions predicted as fraud were actually fraudulent.\n",

        "    *   The confusion matrix revealed 165 True Positives (correctly identified frauds), 225 False Positives (non-frauds identified as frauds), 206 False Negatives (frauds missed), and 3004 True Negatives (correctly identified non-frauds).\n",

        "*   The next crucial step is to perform hyperparameter tuning on the Decision Tree model using techniques like GridSearchCV to optimize its parameters. This optimization should aim to improve metrics critical for fraud detection, such as recall and F1-score for the minority class (fraud).\n"
